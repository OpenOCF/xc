= googletest for cross-compiling

This directory contains is a simple Makefile for
https://github.com/google/googletest[googletest], derived from the
sample Makefile in the distribution.

To use it, first clone or download the googletest repository.

The Makefile is designed to work with the environmental variables set
by the files in link:../source.me[../source.me].

* set `GTEST_DIR` in the targethost file to wherever you cloned/downloaded the googletest repo.
* edit the devhost and targethost files as explained in the link:../README.adoc[xc README]

Then `source` the appropriate files (devhost, then targethost) and run make:

[source,sh]
----
$ source source.me/darwin.devhost
$ source source.me/darwin.targethost
$ make && make install
----

This will build googletest and install it in `${LIB_SYSROOT}/lib`,
which is set by the `sourc` ed files.  In my case that means
`$HOME/iochibity/lib/linux/x86_64/lib`.

It also copies the googletest headers to `${LIB_SYSROOT}/include`.
