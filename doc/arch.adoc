* http://www.arm.com/products/processors/armv8-architecture.php[ARMv8-A]  "The ARMv8 architecture introduces 64-bit support to the ARM architecture with a focus on power-efficient implementation while maintaining compatibility with existing 32-bit software."

Terminology:

* architecture (ARMv8-A)
* execution state (AArch64, AArch32)
* instruction set (A32, T32, A64)

```
Two main execution states:
AArch64 - The 64-bit execution state including exception model, memory model, programmers' model and instruction set support for that state
AArch32 - The 32-bit execution state including exception model, memory model, programmers' model and instruction set support for that state

The execution states support three key instruction sets:

A32 (or ARM): a 32-bit fixed length instruction set, enhanced through the different architecture variants. Part of the 32-bit architecture execution environment now referred to as AArch32.
T32 (Thumb) introduced as a 16-bit fixed-length instruction set, subsequently enhanced to a mixed-length 16- and 32-bit instruction set on the introduction of Thumb-2 technology. Part of the 32-bit architecture execution environment now referred to as AArch32.
A64 is a 64-bit fixed-length instruction set that offers similar functionality to the ARM and Thumb instruction sets. Introduced with ARMv8-A, it is the AArch64 instruction set.
```

* AArch64 is the name for the new 64-bit ARM architecture, also known as ARMv8 or ARM64.
